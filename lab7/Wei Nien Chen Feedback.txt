Great job on this lab.

Some things to consider:

1. In your addHead method, don't forget you still need to assign the head's previous point to your. By default, your newHead prev is already null. You need
   to assign your current head's prev to your newHead. From there, you would also need to consider what needs to happen if your current head is null.

2. find Method - consider the case where you looped through the entire list and value is not found

3. remove Method - remember, we are using a doublely linked list so don't forget to set the prev pointers too!

4. In your reversedCopy method, you can utilize both the addHead/addTail methods as well as the head/tail member fields to return reverse copy.
   It doesn't need to be too complicated.
