Project Idea:

Since we don't have a lot of time, I would have to be realistic with the type of project that I would work on.

I wanted to create a Java program that can handles actions from only ONE user. Seeing what the previous class has worked on, I believe that a game with not too complicated interactions and scoring capabilities would be a good idea. The other idea I have is to build a simple shopping cart system, like a SNKRS app, but that would be less interesting.

With the game idea, users can perform a few simple actions - moving, scoring, pause game, enter game, exit game
Things to consider:
- end conditions of game
- obstacles?
