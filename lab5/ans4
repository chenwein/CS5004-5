### Multiple inheritance is not supported in java,  

“extends” keyword applies to abstract classes and concrete classes, whereas it is okay to “implement” multiple interfaces.
The problem with multiple inheritance is that when you create methods with the same signature in both the parent class and child class, there is a ambiguity as to which method to be called. It becomes a compilation error. Or called the diamond problem.

For example:

```java

Class animal {

	void bark() { 
	//implementation
	}

class dog1 {
	void bark(){
		//implementation
	}
}

class dog2{
	void bark(){
		//implementation
	}
}

class smallDog extends dog1, dog2 {
	//extending both parents classes
}

//driver method
//instantiate a new smallDog object
smallDog testDog = new smallDog();
smallDog.bark() // compile error 

}

```
