Good job with the Lab!

Some things to point out:

1. In your constructor class (and to answer your question), you need to check and if the denomicator is <=0, throw an exception. Your try and catch
   statement will be in written in your main code where you are calling the method. In your main code, when you are calling your constructor, and
   if the constructor return the exception to the main code, that is where you want to catch any exception thrown and handle accordingly.

2. You do not need to call the setter method in your constructor. As Marked posted on Piazza, it's not really a good idea to have setter methods in
   your constructor or any other methods within the class. The setter and getter methods are typically used in a different class that would be using
   your Fraction class to access the individual member data.

   Within the class itself, you can directly access the numerator and denominator members by
   calling this.numerator or this.denominator. So your constructor class would look something like:
   public Fraction (int num, int den){
      this.num = num;
      this.den = den;
   } 

3. For junit testing, please make sure each method has the same name as the method you are testing from the main class. Also, it's best to
   have multiple tests for each method instead of just one test for the entire code

Thanks for adding Java docs comments to the Person & Book class!
