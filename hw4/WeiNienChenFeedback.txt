Asssignment 4 Feedback for Wei Nien Chen

Points breakdown:
Constructor: 6/12
addTerm: 12/12
removeTerm: 12/12
getDegree: 12/12
getCoefficient: 12/12
evaluate: 12/12
add: 12/12
toString: 11/12

Exception throws and private vs public: 4/4

Notes:
1. You are missing a constructor that takes a string as an argument and parses it
into a linked list. You can use regex for this. 

2. For toString, please make sure you follow the format exactly.
For example, the expected format is: 5x^2 + 4x^1 + -2, and yours is 5X^2+4X^1 -2, 
which caused a lot of tests to fail. This is important for future assignments so please
try to take care to be accurate. 


Overall, great job, just make sure to follow the directions closely!
Grade: 93/100
