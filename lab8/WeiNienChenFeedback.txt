Notes:
I think you forgot to upload your ListNode java file?

For addInt, you don't need to put things in order
because sets are usually in random order. 
Also, I see how you are checking for duplicates,
but it may be easier to just check if the item is
already in the set before adding it. Right now, you add method
fails for some cases - I think something in either addInt or removeRep is 
not quite right. Also, if there is a duplicate, it should return false
when removed, but yours returns true. 

For remove, you need to check the edge case of it being the head.
If not, then you prev is still null when you say prev.next = curr.next,
and you get a null pointer exception because you cannot call null.next.

I think you are missing the union method - not necessary for the grade but
good practice if you have time. 

Overall, good job, but make sure you test your methods
because it's very easy to run into null pointer exception
with linked lists.
